        <p>I'm a full stack web development student. I'm learning that I have a passion for creating both meaningful, and visually pleasing user experiences. I love a puzzle, and I love figuring out how to apply a tech solution to a human problem.</p>
        <p>In my previous life, I was grinding away in the hospitality industry, working my way up to my most recent posting as Head Sommelier, where I did everything from managing people, to managing inventory, to InDesign wizardry, to always sharing my knowlegde wine.</p>
        <p>Hospitality, and studying to be a sommelier has equipped me with tremendous interpersonal skills, and instilled in me a passion for always seeking more knowlegde. That's surprisingly not so different from web development, after all, there's a lot of collaboration in web development, and an endless amount to learn. </p>
        <p>When I'm not learning to code I love to cook, and to attempt baking. I love spending time outdoors whether with a good book, or on a run. And of course, I'm always in pursuit of the next best wine.</p>
